    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

    <h2>1. What is this website about?</h2>
    <p>This personal website shares my life story, experiences, and feelings. It is a platform to connect with people worldwide and seek support to help me gain freedom and safety.</p>

    <h2>2. How can I contact you?</h2>
    <p>For security reasons, I currently do not share any personal information publicly on this website. However, anyone who gets in touch with me can receive personal information after proper verification and trust-building.</p>

    <h2>3. Why not just use social media for donations instead of creating a website?</h2>
    <p>That’s a great question — and I actually do use social media too! But here’s why I decided to create this website:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A website is searchable on Google. People can find it more easily, even without me directly sending them a link.</li>
      <li>It looks more official and trustworthy. When someone sees a personal website, they can tell I’ve put time and effort into it. It shows I’m serious, not just someone trying to scam others for quick money.</li>
      <li>Social media alone doesn’t build trust. Many people assume donation requests on platforms like Twitter or Instagram are fake. Even though I’ve shared my story before on X (Twitter) — and my profile link is in the “Contact Me” section — I’ve never received even $1 😅</li>
      <li>This site helps me tell my full story. Social media posts are limited and easily ignored. Here, I can explain who I am, what I’ve been through, and how people can truly help — all in one place.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That’s why this website is the heart of my campaign — and social media is just the loudspeaker.</p>

    <h2>4. Are you really planning to seek asylum? What kind of asylum? And why do you think people should help you?</h2>
    <p>Yes, seeking asylum is my only realistic path to freedom — specifically, asylum due to domestic violence. I live under harsh and unsafe conditions, and I have no legal rights to study or work. My life and future are completely limited.</p>
    <p>There’s only one small exception: if the regime in Iran is overthrown and replaced with a real democratic government that truly respects human rights — and if such a government actively helps people like me — then I would consider moving to Tehran and starting over there, away from my abusive family. But realistically, I don’t think that will happen anytime soon.</p>
    <p>Some people may say: “Why don’t you earn money online with your phone?” The truth is: Iran is under heavy U.S. sanctions. I cannot work internationally or use many platforms due to restrictions. I’ve also tried many local opportunities, but most of them were scams. I’ve been tricked, blocked, and lost borrowed money multiple times.</p>
    <p>I do have real skills:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Channel and Page Management:</strong> I’ve worked as an admin for social media accounts. But because I have no official work history, nobody hires me. When they do, it’s often a scam — they ask for a registration fee and disappear.</li>
      <li><strong>NFT Projects:</strong> I have knowledge in NFTs, but creating and selling them requires upfront investment. With no access to stable internet, proper devices, or reliable VPNs (with fixed IPs), I can’t even start — especially with platforms that block Iranians.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, I’m reaching out here because every door I’ve tried to open is locked. I’m stuck, and I need real support to escape and build a free life.</p>

    <h2>5. Why are you trying to escape your family? Can't things be solved peacefully?</h2>
    <p>In Iran, even children who are physically abused have very limited options. The government may provide support only up to age 18 — after that, you're on your own. I was physically abused as a child, but I had no idea where to turn for help. I also thought I deserved it, because I was made to feel like it was my fault.</p>
    <p>As I grew older, the abuse became more emotional and mental — restrictions, control, and complete lack of freedom. For example, I wasn’t allowed to go anywhere without permission, and I only got my first phone at 18. I’m treated more like a servant than a family member. That’s why I say emotional abuse is often worse than physical pain.</p>
    <p>Through research and personal experience, I’ve found that my emotional struggles and identity — including being part of the ABDL (Adult Baby/Diaper Lover) community — are deeply connected to this trauma. In restrictive societies like Iran, ABDL is growing silently, and although it’s not widely known, I used to run a Persian ABDL blog and met many people who shared the same experience.</p>
    <p>If you are part of the ABDL community or want to support someone who is, you can contact me through the Contact Me page.</p>
