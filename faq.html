    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

    <h2>1. What is this website about?</h2>
    <p>This is a personal platform where I share my real story, thoughts, and struggles — and ask for honest support. My goal is to reach people who care about human rights, freedom, and truth.</p>

    <h2>2. How can I contact you?</h2>
    <p>For safety reasons, direct contact info isn't public. But if someone reaches out through trusted channels, I can respond after proper trust is built. Please use the "Contact Me" page for updates.</p>

    <h2>3. Why not only use social media for support?</h2>
    <p>Social media is helpful, but not reliable for serious causes like this. People often ignore posts, assume scams, or never engage. A website is permanent, searchable, and gives me space to explain things fully. It's also a sign that I’m serious and invested in change.</p>

    <h2>4. Are you really seeking asylum?</h2>
    <p>Yes. I'm trying to escape long-term abuse and lack of basic rights. My asylum case is based on domestic violence and emotional trauma. I live in fear and have no legal protection here.</p>
    <p>I've tried many paths — including working online — but due to sanctions, scams, and lack of local opportunities, nothing worked. I'm not asking for pity. I’m asking for a chance to live.</p>

    <h2>5. Why not stay and solve family issues peacefully?</h2>
    <p>In my country, even physical abuse is rarely taken seriously — especially after age 18. Emotional abuse is invisible but even more painful. I’ve been isolated, controlled, and made to feel worthless for years.</p>
    <p>My ABDL identity is deeply linked to this trauma. It’s not a "fetish" — it’s a coping mechanism rooted in childhood pain. I’ve met others like me, and many suffer in silence. Leaving is my only hope to heal and rebuild.</p>
