        <h2>About Mani Meshkinpoor ❤️‍🩹</h2>
        <p>
          I am from Iran, and besides the many problems in my country,  
          I suffer under very harsh and dictatorial parents who constantly abuse me both mentally and physically.<br><br>
          To be clear from the start, <strong>Mani Meshkinpoor</strong> is my pen name, and for security reasons, I cannot share my real personal information.<br><br>
          Most of the abuse I endure is emotional. I have been forbidden from working or studying.<br>
          When I was a child, I had no knowledge or ability to seek help from the police. Now, at 20 years old,  
          no support is given to anyone over 18 here in Iran.<br><br>
          I am in urgent financial need to be able to leave the country and seek asylum.<br>
          I tried once before and went to Turkey, but they told me I had to wait in line for a month before applying.<br>
          Without money, I had no choice but to return home. 😔<br><br>
          Due to U.S. sanctions, any charity site I visit immediately blocks my accounts.<br><br>
          I once attempted suicide but failed. Now I have found a painless and certain way.<br><br>
          My only hope is your help — even a small donation to my Tether (TRC20) wallet would mean the world to me.<br><br>
          🙏 <strong>Even just 1 dollar is a huge amount for me.</strong> If you can’t donate, please share my site with your friends who might help.<br>
          And if no one can help financially, please visit my blog daily and share it so more people know about my story.<br>
          Soon, I will connect Google AdSense ads to this blog, so even your presence will help me. ♥️<br><br>
          ⚠️ Please have mercy. If you can’t help, at least don’t report my blog.<br>
          I’ve worked very hard on this site, and it wouldn’t be fair for my efforts to be erased overnight.<br><br>
          The site is still in early testing phases, so if you find any problems, please contact me via the social media links below immediately.<br>
          The blog is constantly updated.<br><br>
          I don’t even have a computer — my father never bought me one — I only have a smartphone, and I don’t know coding.<br>
          Thanks to ChatGPT (the free version!), by copying and pasting code in Termux, I managed to build this blog myself. 😁
